## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

During this project I mainly learned to be extremely patient, as I had to try several times with different codes to finally get the desired results.*

### Continued development

I would like to continue improving the optimization of the code itself in order to not have to write unnecessary lines, which will not only save time but also make the code easier to read.
